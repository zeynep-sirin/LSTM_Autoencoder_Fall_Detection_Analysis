# LSTM_Autoencoder_Fall_Detection_Analysis
Deep Learning project using an LSTM Autoencoder for Fall Detection in sensor data. Optimized architecture (Deep LSTM, Tanh, LR=0.00001) to stabilize Nan errors. Final analysis yielded a low Recall of 2.75%, demonstrating the limitation of the unsupervised Autoencoder approach for high-noise time-series anomaly detection.
